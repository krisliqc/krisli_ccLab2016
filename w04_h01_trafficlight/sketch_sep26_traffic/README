This is a script that mimics the way traffic lights work.

The circuit includes 
3 LED lights: r(red), y(yellow) and g(green).
2 buttons: buttonR(red light on) and buttonG(green light on).

When buttonR is pressed, the yellow light flashes twice and the red light comes on(while button is held).

When buttonG is pressed, the green light comes on immediately and the other two turn off.
