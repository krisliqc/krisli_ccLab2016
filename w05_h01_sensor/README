This is the script for week 5 using a Ultrasonic HC SR04 sensor.

There are 6 LEDs, when an object is far away nothing lights up, 
when the object gets closer they each light up one by one.
The green lights are the furthest, if the red lights are on you've come too close.

I referenced J. Rodrigo Tech to get the ultrasonic sensor data.
