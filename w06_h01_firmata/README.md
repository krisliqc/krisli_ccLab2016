This processing file creates a visual representation of the force which is being applied to a pressure sensor.

I applied Firmata and included [1 analog Arduino INPUT: pressure sensor] and [2 digital Arduino OUTPUTs: 2 LEDs].

The more force there is, the higher the graph grows in the Processing sketch, and the LEDs light up accordingly.
