This script is taken from http://www.electroschematics.com/9809/arduino-8-bit-binary-led/, written by P.Marian.

He created a system with 8 LEDs to mimic a 8bit binary counter which counts up to 255.

I added a function (the else statement) that at the count of 8 (presses = 8), the count resets and all lights should come on, flash twice and go out.
The response is shown in the .mov, but it does not last as long as I expected.
I wrote my notes after //// to differentiate from his original notes.
