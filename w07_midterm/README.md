Maze games

Concept:
I aimed to create a path-finding game, which takes physical input from players and manifest the behavior on screen.

To create the visuals of the game, I imported a maze image and covered the image with darkness, and isolated portions of the map lights up gradually according to the position of the player.
The physical control consists of two parts: one joystick for directional input, and one pressure sensor for speed variation.

When the player approaches the wall of the maze, a prompt appears saying "stay within the walls"; and as the player discovers the treasure box, a message says "you have found the treasure".
