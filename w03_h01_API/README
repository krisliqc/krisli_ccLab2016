This website uses the weather API to visually display the length of a day.

I used the astronomy section of this API, I extrated the time of sunrise, sunset and the moon luminosity from the API response. (js line 49-51)

Once the city location is entered, a bar extends at the bottom of the screen, showing the span of a day over 0h-24h.
I used a color gradient to represent different periods in the day.
The brightness of the circle varies based on the luminosity data of the moon.

(To see a greater change in the length of the day in different cities, choose cities with greater latitude differences.)
